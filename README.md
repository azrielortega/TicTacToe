# TicTacToe
This repository contains a Java implementation of the classic game, featuring three levels of AI opponents with varying levels of intelligence. Challenge yourself and see if you can outsmart these AI adversaries!

### Game Levels
  1. <b>Randomizer AI</b>: The first level introduces the Randomizer AI, which makes moves in a completely random manner.
  2. <b>Brute-Force AI</b>: The second level presents the Brute-Force AI, which follows a set of predefined rules to analyze the game board and make moves based on a brute force approach. 
  3. <b>MinMax AI</b>: The third level presents the MinMax AI. It uses the  min-max algorithm, evaluating every possible move and selecting the one that maximizes its chances of winning or minimizes its chances of losing.
